> [!IMPORTANT]
> **READ BEFORE PROCEEDING**
> To ensure these filters function correctly and to manage support requests effectively, the following rules are strictly enforced.

### 🚫 No Support Zones
Do **not** expect any help or updates regarding:

### ⚙️ Required Environment
For the filters to work as intended (and to be eligible for support), your setup **must** match the following:

* **Browser:** [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) is highly recommended.
* **Extension:** **uBlock Origin (MV2)**. 
    * *Note: There is no support for uBlock Origin Lite (MV3).*
* **Clean Browser:** No extra extensions that perform blocking or page modification. **uBlock Origin is enough.**
* **No External Blocking:** You must not use any **DNS** or **3rd Party Apps** that block ads (e.g., NextDNS, AdGuard App, Pi-hole).

### 🛠️ uBlock Origin Configuration
Please use the **Default Filters**, plus these specific additions if needed:
* ✅ **EasyList + AdGuard Annoyances** (Cookie notices, Social widgets, and Annoyances *only*)**

**Failure to follow these requirements will result in your issue being closed without assistance.**
