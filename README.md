***Do not expect any help regarding Bitcoin,faucet site and shortners from me

Everyone is expected to use firefox with mv2 uBlockOrigin(with firefox if possible)
Theres no support for mv3 uBlockOrigin lite (considering only i help)
You shouldn't have any dns/App that blocks ads in a browser
Also no extra extension that does any blocking/modification in browser(Only uBlockOrigin is enough)
You should have uBlockOrigin default filters + you can use Easylist And Adguard's Cookie notices,Social widgets, Annoyances only
And i wont help in any bitcoin,faucet links
